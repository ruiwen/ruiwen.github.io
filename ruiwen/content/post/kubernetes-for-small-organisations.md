# Kubernetes for small Organisations: Is it worth it?

{{< youtube zjVcUg1JTBk >}}

I recently gave a talk at GeekcampSG 2016 about our ongoing experience with Kubernetes in Lomotif.

It wasn't a technical deep-dive, so I didn't talk very much about the implementation itself, but more about the experience in general, and the pitfalls that we came across. Hopefully, if you're planning a move to Kubernetes, this talk could give you a heads up of a couple of gotchas that you'll probably want to pay attention to before jumping in.

Also great thanks and a shout-out to the wonderful folk from [Engineers.SG](https://engineers.sg) who recorded and uploaded the talks from GeekcampSG! =)
