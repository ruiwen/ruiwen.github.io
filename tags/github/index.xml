      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of talk about how easy it is to setup a statically-generated blog (such as this!) using a static site generator and hosting it on Github pages.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at a simple git workflow that can be used to manage a statically-generated site, such as this.
Github pages usually publish the content from the master branch of a git repo, and while some tips found online might suggest keeping the generated content and the source material in separate repos, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to have them all in one project that can be managed all at the same time.</description>
