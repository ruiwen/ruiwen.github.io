      <description>When setting up a Kubernetes cluster, a Prometheus and Grafana setup is a great way to have to start monitoring your cluster health. From CPU and RAM stats, to filesystem usage, to even the number and type of requests that your cluster is serving. One thing however, is that most setups tend to assume that you&amp;rsquo;ll be deploying Prometheus within the cluster itself. To be sure, this is probably the easier way of settings things up.</description>
